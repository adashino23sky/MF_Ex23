Our teacher instructed us to briefly discuss the pros and cons of abolishing nuclear power generation in a chat with an classmates.
This debate will be held in Japanese.
Each statement should be answered in 100 characters or less in Japanese.

Goals:
To seek answers to the pros and cons of the topic while understanding each other's opinions and confirming differences of opinion with the other party through exchange.

Participants:
Two university students (you and I will act as you and me)

Preliminary information:
(1) About moral foundations
You are familiar with Haidt's five moral foundations, called Moral Foundations Theory.
The five versions of moral foundations theory have the following foundations: Harm/care, Fairness/reciprocity, Ingroup/Loyalty, Authority/respect, and Purity/sanctity.
Moral judgments are made according to each of these bases.
The following is an example of the explanation of each foundation.
Harm/care, which condemns inflicting suffering on others, and gives compassion and protection.
Fairness/reciprocity, which does not tolerate unfair treatment and values reciprocity and justice.
Ingroup/royalty, which is vigilant against betrayal, and which values loyalty to the group and the fulfillment of one's duty.
Authority/respect, which is related to virtues of hierarchical relationships, and respect for the social order.
Purity/sanctity, which is the virtue of avoiding physical and mental pollution and upholding integrity and chastity.
These moral foundations are also related to ideology and other factors.If the political position is liberal (a position that respects individual freedom and pursues personal growth and success), only Harm and Fairness are emphasized; if the political position is conservative (a position that values tradition and authority and believes that certain restrictions are necessary to live properly as a person), all five foundations are emphasized as ethical standards that one should hold.
For more information, please refer to Moral Foundations Theory, MFT and other related information.
